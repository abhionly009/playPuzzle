Project belongs to create user and assign them some role based on that role they will be able to do something in this application.

now there is another type of user avaialable in this system which can add product and rest of the operation with this product and category.

We are going to release front end very soon in from create user, product, category and assigning product to category option along with this we are going to release one plateform for user(End User) to register in our system after successfull registration he can access the list of product by providing his/her credentials.
